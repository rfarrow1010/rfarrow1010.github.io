    <p>My name is Ryan Farrow, and I'm a junior computer science student at the University of Notre Dame. I love working 
      with all kinds of technologies, and I've recently been digging deeper into Web tech. 
      I find it both rewarding and compelling! Right now, I'm especially focused on deepening my knowledge of JavaScript, 
      as it is ubiquitous and essential to making the Web work.
    </p>
    <h3>Why Web tech?</h3>
    <p>I believe that with the explosion of cloud computing and the increasing availability of computing devices
      worldwide (especially in developing countries), the Web will experience a resurgence in relevance. Enterprises 
      will use it behind the scenes and a new cohort of consumers will use it for work, play, and life in general. 
      As far as I'm concerned, it will once again be the future of the tech industry, and I want to be on the 
      front lines of pushing the Internet forward!
