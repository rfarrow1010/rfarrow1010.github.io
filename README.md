This is the page for my personal tech demo website. I have a lot of information on here about my technical 
experience that doesn't easily fit on a resume. I don't claim to be a world-class graphic designer or Web
developer, so please excuse the old-fashioned look of the site. But don't take my word for it; have a look
yourself!
